***Linux for DevOps***

apt update
apt upgrade

what is /bin folder
The /bin folder in Linux stands for "binary" and contains essential command-line binaries (executable programs) that are needed for the system to boot and run in single-user mode.
Key points:
It holds essential user commands, like:
ls (list directory contents)
cp (copy files)
mv (move/rename files)
rm (remove files)
bash (Bourne Again Shell)
These commands are available to all users, including during system recovery or when no other filesystems are mounted.





what is /sbin folder
The /sbin folder stands for "system binary" and contains essential system administration commands — mostly used by the root (superuser) for system maintenance and recovery.
Key points:
It includes commands like:
ifconfig (configure network interfaces)
reboot (restart the system)
fsck (file system check)
iptables (firewall rules)
These are not typically used by regular users.
Like /bin, it's critical during booting and single-user mode.





what is /dev folder
The /dev folder in Linux stands for "device" and contains device files that represent hardware and virtual devices attached to the system.
Key points:
Devices are treated like files in Linux — this is called "everything is a file" philosophy.
Common entries:
/dev/sda → first hard disk
/dev/tty → terminal devices
/dev/null → data sink (discard everything written to it)
/dev/zero → provides unlimited null bytes (0s)
/dev/random → provides random numbers
These files are mostly created dynamically by the udev device manager during boot or when devices are connected.






what is /var folder
The /var directory in Linux stands for "variable" and contains files that change frequently while the system is running.
Key contents:
/var/log/ → log files (e.g., system logs, app logs)
/var/mail/ → user mailbox files
/var/spool/ → queues for tasks like printing or cron jobs
/var/tmp/ → temporary files preserved between reboots
/var/cache/ → cached data for apps to speed things up
Think of /var as the writable counterpart to the mostly static /etc or /bin.







what is /mnt folder
The /mnt directory in Linux stands for "mount" and is used as a temporary mount point for mounting external storage devices like USB drives, hard disks, or network shares.
Key points:
You can manually mount a device to /mnt, like:
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
It's often used by system administrators for manual, short-term mounts.
For permanent mounts, custom directories under /mnt or /media are often used.





what is /media folder
The /media directory in Linux is used for automatically mounting external media like USB drives, CDs, DVDs, or SD cards, typically when a user plugs them in.
Key points:
Modern Linux systems (like Ubuntu) auto-mount devices to /media/<username> :Example: /media/prince/MyUSB
Unlike /mnt (used for manual mounts), /media is used for auto-mounted removable devices handled by the desktop environment or udisks.






what is /usr folder
The /usr directory in Linux stands for "Unix System Resources" and contains user-related programs and data — not user files, but system-wide read-only software and libraries for normal (non-boot-critical) operations.
Key contents:
/usr/bin/ → non-essential user commands (e.g., gcc, python)
/usr/sbin/ → non-essential system admin commands (e.g., apache2)
/usr/lib/ → libraries for binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
/usr/share/ → architecture-independent files (e.g., docs, icons)
/usr/local/ → for software installed manually by the user
💡 Note: Unlike /bin and /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin are not needed during early boot.







what is /etc folder
The /etc directory in Linux contains system-wide configuration files and shell scripts used to configure the system and its applications.
Key points:
All files are usually text-based config files.
Examples:
/etc/passwd → user account info
/etc/fstab → file system mount config
/etc/hostname → system hostname
/etc/ssh/sshd_config → SSH server settings
Only root or sudo users typically modify /etc.











what is /boot folder
The /boot directory in Linux contains all the files needed to boot the system, including the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk, and bootloader configuration files.
Key contents:
/boot/vmlinuz-* → compressed Linux kernel
/boot/initrd.img-* → initial RAM disk (used during boot to load drivers before root filesystem is available)
/boot/grub/ → GRUB bootloader configuration files
/boot/config-* → kernel configuration settings
This folder is usually on the root partition, but on some systems (like UEFI setups), it may be a separate partition.







what is /opt folder
The /opt directory in Linux stands for "optional" and is used to install third-party software packages that are not managed by the system's package manager.
Key points:
Software installed here usually lives in its own subdirectory, e.g.:
/opt/google/ → Google Chrome
/opt/vscode/ → Visual Studio Code
Good place for manually downloaded apps or proprietary software.
Keeps custom or vendor software separate from system files.
💡 Tip: You often need sudo to install to or modify anything in /opt.






what is /home folder
The /home directory in Linux contains personal directories for all regular (non-root) users, where each user can store their own files, settings, and data.
Key points:
Example: For a user named prince, their home directory is /home/prince
Inside /home/prince, you'll find:
Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc.
Hidden config files like .bashrc, .gitconfig
Each user has full control over their own home directory.
💡 The superuser (root) has a separate home: /root




what is /tmp folder
/tmp in Linux:
The /tmp directory is used for temporary files created by applications and the system. These files are:
Short-lived — can be deleted at reboot
Accessible to all users (with some permissions restrictions)
Often used for:
Temporary download files
Sockets and pipes
Lock files
