***Linux for DevOps***


what is /bin folder
The /bin folder in Linux stands for "binary" and contains essential command-line binaries (executable programs) that are needed for the system to boot and run in single-user mode.
Key points:
It holds essential user commands, like:
ls (list directory contents)
cp (copy files)
mv (move/rename files)
rm (remove files)
bash (Bourne Again Shell)
These commands are available to all users, including during system recovery or when no other filesystems are mounted.





what is /sbin folder
The /sbin folder stands for "system binary" and contains essential system administration commands â€” mostly used by the root (superuser) for system maintenance and recovery.
Key points:
It includes commands like:
ifconfig (configure network interfaces)
reboot (restart the system)
fsck (file system check)
iptables (firewall rules)
These are not typically used by regular users.
Like /bin, it's critical during booting and single-user mode.





what is /dev folder
The /dev folder in Linux stands for "device" and contains device files that represent hardware and virtual devices attached to the system.
Key points:
Devices are treated like files in Linux â€” this is called "everything is a file" philosophy.
Common entries:
/dev/sda â†’ first hard disk
/dev/tty â†’ terminal devices
/dev/null â†’ data sink (discard everything written to it)
/dev/zero â†’ provides unlimited null bytes (0s)
/dev/random â†’ provides random numbers
These files are mostly created dynamically by the udev device manager during boot or when devices are connected.






what is /var folder
The /var directory in Linux stands for "variable" and contains files that change frequently while the system is running.
Key contents:
/var/log/ â†’ log files (e.g., system logs, app logs)
/var/mail/ â†’ user mailbox files
/var/spool/ â†’ queues for tasks like printing or cron jobs
/var/tmp/ â†’ temporary files preserved between reboots
/var/cache/ â†’ cached data for apps to speed things up
Think of /var as the writable counterpart to the mostly static /etc or /bin.







what is /mnt folder
The /mnt directory in Linux stands for "mount" and is used as a temporary mount point for mounting external storage devices like USB drives, hard disks, or network shares.
Key points:
You can manually mount a device to /mnt, like:
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
It's often used by system administrators for manual, short-term mounts.
For permanent mounts, custom directories under /mnt or /media are often used.





what is /media folder
The /media directory in Linux is used for automatically mounting external media like USB drives, CDs, DVDs, or SD cards, typically when a user plugs them in.
Key points:
Modern Linux systems (like Ubuntu) auto-mount devices to /media/<username> :Example: /media/prince/MyUSB
Unlike /mnt (used for manual mounts), /media is used for auto-mounted removable devices handled by the desktop environment or udisks.






what is /usr folder
The /usr directory in Linux stands for "Unix System Resources" and contains user-related programs and data â€” not user files, but system-wide read-only software and libraries for normal (non-boot-critical) operations.
Key contents:
/usr/bin/ â†’ non-essential user commands (e.g., gcc, python)
/usr/sbin/ â†’ non-essential system admin commands (e.g., apache2)
/usr/lib/ â†’ libraries for binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
/usr/share/ â†’ architecture-independent files (e.g., docs, icons)
/usr/local/ â†’ for software installed manually by the user
ðŸ’¡ Note: Unlike /bin and /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin are not needed during early boot.







what is /etc folder
The /etc directory in Linux contains system-wide configuration files and shell scripts used to configure the system and its applications.
Key points:
All files are usually text-based config files.
Examples:
/etc/passwd â†’ user account info
/etc/fstab â†’ file system mount config
/etc/hostname â†’ system hostname
/etc/ssh/sshd_config â†’ SSH server settings
Only root or sudo users typically modify /etc.











what is /boot folder
The /boot directory in Linux contains all the files needed to boot the system, including the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk, and bootloader configuration files.
Key contents:
/boot/vmlinuz-* â†’ compressed Linux kernel
/boot/initrd.img-* â†’ initial RAM disk (used during boot to load drivers before root filesystem is available)
/boot/grub/ â†’ GRUB bootloader configuration files
/boot/config-* â†’ kernel configuration settings
This folder is usually on the root partition, but on some systems (like UEFI setups), it may be a separate partition.







what is /opt folder
The /opt directory in Linux stands for "optional" and is used to install third-party software packages that are not managed by the system's package manager.
Key points:
Software installed here usually lives in its own subdirectory, e.g.:
/opt/google/ â†’ Google Chrome
/opt/vscode/ â†’ Visual Studio Code
Good place for manually downloaded apps or proprietary software.
Keeps custom or vendor software separate from system files.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: You often need sudo to install to or modify anything in /opt.






what is /home folder
The /home directory in Linux contains personal directories for all regular (non-root) users, where each user can store their own files, settings, and data.
Key points:
Example: For a user named prince, their home directory is /home/prince
Inside /home/prince, you'll find:
Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc.
Hidden config files like .bashrc, .gitconfig
Each user has full control over their own home directory.
ðŸ’¡ The superuser (root) has a separate home: /root




what is /tmp folder
/tmp in Linux:
The /tmp directory is used for temporary files created by applications and the system. These files are:
Short-lived â€” can be deleted at reboot
Accessible to all users (with some permissions restrictions)
Often used for:
Temporary download files
Sockets and pipes
Lock files





for create single directories
mkdir folder_name 
ex-> mkdir DevOps

to deleted single directory
rm -r folder_name or rmdir folder_name

ðŸ”— Hard Link
âœ… Definition:
A hard link is an additional name for an existing file. Both the original and the hard link point to the same inode (i.e., same data on disk).
ln /home/ubantu/devops/cloud/dev.txt hardLinkFile
Shares the same data/inode.
If the original file is deleted, the hard link still works.
Can only be created for files, not directories.
Must be on the same filesystem.


ðŸ”— Soft Link (Symbolic Link)
âœ… Definition:
A soft link (or symlink) is a shortcut or reference to another file path.
ln -s original.txt symlink.txt
ln -s /home/ubantu/devops/cloud/dev.txt softLinkFile
Stores the path to the target file, not the data.
Breaks if the original file is deleted or moved.
Can link to files or directories.
Works across filesystems.


ðŸ”— Cut
âœ… Definition:
Cut and display bytes 1 to 4 from each line of file.txt.
cut -b 1-3 filename.txt


ðŸ”— tee
âœ… Definition:
The tee command in Linux is used to read from standard input and write to both a file and the terminal at the same time.
echo "Hello Prince" | tee file.txt
âœ… To append instead of overwrite:
echo "Hello Prince" | tee -a file.txt

ðŸ”— Sort
âœ… Definition:
The sort command in Linux is used to sort lines of text files.
sort filename.txt
